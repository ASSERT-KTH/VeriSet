Anyone can set the password by calling `PasswordStore::setPassword`.

The `PasswordStore` contract assumes that only the owner can set the password. The `setPassword()` function modifies the 
`s_password` storage variable, where the password is set, but doesn't include access control meaning that anyone, including 
a malicious actor, can reset the owner's password.

A possible potential use case for this contract is that the owner, the address stored in the storage variable `s_owner`, 
wants to use the contract as a password manager. If someone else can modify the password then the contract will not return 
the password they intended to store. This negates the intended use of the contract.

Since anyone, inluding malicious actors, can set the password, this opens up to the possibility that, depending on the context, 
these unsantisied and potentially malicious strings could be dangerous.

As per the following NatSpec comment: `This function allows only the owner to set a new password`, only the owner being able to 
set the password is the core assumtion, and functionality that does not hold, this is a high severity vulnerability.
