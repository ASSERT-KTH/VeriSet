PoC:
The PoC first creates funds to be "liquidated".
Then it haves holder1 and holder2 stake their funds.
Then holder3 (the attacker) stakes a tiny bit of funds.
Liquidation happens (25% should go to holder1, 75% to holder2, and 0% to holder3).

It then shows the balance of the attacker and the liquidationPool.
Then it deploys and executes the exploit contract.
It claims the rewards and drains the pool.
At last, it shows the final balance of the attacker and the liquidationPool.

Exploit contract:
This exploits the liquidationPool distributeAssets() function by crafting fake Tokens wrapped in Assets
that bypasses all the checks and allows to get an inflated reward.
The calculation of the amountETH, amountWBTC and amountUSDC are calculated to precisely and completely
drain the pool.
