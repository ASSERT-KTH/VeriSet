The protocol implements a Liquidation Pool to collect the results of Vault Liquidations. 
The collected assets are shared between the stakers who invested in the pool. However, the function performing the 
reward distribution can be called by anyone and the rewards can be manipulated by a specially crafted payload, resulting in 
all rewards being stollen by a malicious actor.

To liquidate a vault the users should call the `runLiquidation()` function of the `LiquidationPoolManager` which internally 
calls the `distributeAssets()` function of the `LiquidationPool`. The problem is that we can call the `distributeAssets()` 
directly with any payload and a malicious list of `Assets`.

An attacker who only invested a tiny amount into the pool can claim 100% of the rewards.
