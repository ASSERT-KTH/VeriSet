Owner's password stored in the `s_password` state variable is not a secret and can be seen by everyone.

The protocol is using a `private` state variable to store the owner's password under the assumption that being a 
"private" variable its value is a secret from everyone else except the owner; which is a completely false assumption.

In Solidity, marking a variable as `private` doesn't mean that the data stored in that variable is entirely secret or private 
from all observers of the blockchain. While it restricts direct external access to the variable from other contracts, it's 
essential to understand that the data on the blockchain is inherently transparent and can be viewed by anyone. Other smart 
contracts and blockchain explorers can still access and read the data if they know where to look.

'Private' in Solidity primarily provides encapsulation and access control within the contract itself, rather than offering 
complete data privacy on the public blockchain.

Aforementioned is the `s_password` variable which is being assumed as a secret by the protocol for it being a `private` variable. 
This is a completely false assumption since all data on the blockchain is public.
