The test defines and sets the victims password.

    Note: By observing the protocol's source code at `PasswordStore.sol`, we notice that `s_password` is the second storage 
    variable declared in the contract. Since storage slots are alloted in the order of declaration in the EVM, its slot value 
    will be '1'

Then the test accesses the protocol's storage data at slot 1, converts the 'bytes' data to a 'string', 
and exposes the victims password on console.
