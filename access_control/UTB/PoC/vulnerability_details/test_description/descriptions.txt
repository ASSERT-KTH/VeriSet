testUTBReceiveFromBridge_SwapWethToUsdcAndMintAnNFTWithFee: 
A benign test function to ensure normal swaps with fees are working as intended, where Alice executes a 
signed inter-chain swap between WETH and USDC before minting a VeryCoolCat test NFT to Bob. 
Adapted from the [`UTBExactOutRoutesTest:testSwapWethToUsdcAndMintAnNft`]
[test](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/011f62059f3a0b1f3577c8ccd1140f0cf3e7bb29/test/UTBExactOutRoutesTestEth2Eth.t.sol#L31).

testUTBReceiveFromBridge_BypassFeesAndSignature: 
Demonstrating the issue by using the same swap with fee payload used in the 
`testUTBReceiveFromBridge_SwapWethToUsdcAndMintAnNFTWithFee` test, sent through the `UTB:receiveFromBridge` function.

testUTBReceiveFromBridge_ArbitraryCalldata: 
Demonstrating the issue by causing arbitrary unsigned calldata to be executed via the `UTB:receiveFromBridge` function. 
Note that a swap between the same WETH token, for amount 0, was used as the swap instructions for this test for clarity.
