testPocAccrueFluxMultipleTimes first creates a veALCX position and casts a vote. The crucial part is the subsequent 
repeated calls to the voter.poke(tokenId) function within the same epoch. 
The test checks if the unclaimed flux balance for the veALCX token increases after each subsequent poke call within the 
same epoch, proving that a user can accrue flux repeatedly and thus exploit the vulnerability for potential gain.
