Reccomended mitgation:

In `unfollow()`, consider allowing the owner of `unfollowerProfileId` to unfollow as well:

            // Follow token is wrapped.
            address unfollowerProfileOwner = IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(unfollowerProfileId);
            // Follower profile owner or its approved delegated executor must hold the token or be approved-for-all.
            if (
+               transactionExecutor != unfollowerProfileOwner && 
                (followTokenOwner != unfollowerProfileOwner) &&
                (followTokenOwner != transactionExecutor) &&
                !isApprovedForAll(followTokenOwner, transactionExecutor) &&
                !isApprovedForAll(followTokenOwner, unfollowerProfileOwner)
            ) {
                revert DoesNotHavePermissions();
            }
