Users cannot unfollow if they do not own the FollowNFT of the `followTokenId` used for their profile.

If the `followTokenId` of a profile is wrapped, users will only be able to unfollow if they are either:

    1. The owner of the follow NFT.
    2. An approved operator of the follow NFT's owner.

This can be seen in the `unfollow()` function of `FollowNFT.sol`:

    // Follow token is wrapped.
    address unfollowerProfileOwner = IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(unfollowerProfileId);
    // Follower profile owner or its approved delegated executor must hold the token or be approved-for-all.
    if (
        (followTokenOwner != unfollowerProfileOwner) &&
        (followTokenOwner != transactionExecutor) &&
        !isApprovedForAll(followTokenOwner, transactionExecutor) &&
        !isApprovedForAll(followTokenOwner, unfollowerProfileOwner)
    ) {
        revert DoesNotHavePermissions();
    }

As seen from above, users that are not the owner or do not have approval for the wrapped follow NFT will not be able to unfollow. 
This is problematic as users are able to follow with a `followTokenId` without owning the corresponding follow NFT.

For example, someone who holds a follow NFT can call [`approveFollow()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-lens/blob/main/contracts/FollowNFT.sol#L141-L153) 
for a user. The user can then call `follow()` with the corresponding `followTokenId`, which works as `_followWithWrappedToken()` 
checks for follow approval:

    bool isFollowApproved = _followApprovalByFollowTokenId[followTokenId] == followerProfileId;
    address followerProfileOwner = IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(followerProfileId);
    if (
        !isFollowApproved &&
        followTokenOwner != followerProfileOwner &&
        followTokenOwner != transactionExecutor &&
        !isApprovedForAll(followTokenOwner, transactionExecutor) &&
        !isApprovedForAll(followTokenOwner, followerProfileOwner)
    ) {
        revert DoesNotHavePermissions();
    }

Now, if the user wants to unfollow, he will be unable to do so by himself, and is forced to rely on the follow 
NFT owner to unfollow for his profile.

Users that follow using a wrapped `followTokenId` that they do not own will not be unfollow the profile. This is 
incorrect as a profile owner should have full control over who the profile does/does not follow.
