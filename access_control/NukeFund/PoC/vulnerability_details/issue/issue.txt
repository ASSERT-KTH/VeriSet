issue: Approved users can't nuke the owner's NFT.

> Consider the following scenario:
>
> 1. Alice approved the `NukeFund` contract as an operator.(Alice called `setApprovalForAll(nukeFund, true)`).
> 2. Alice is the owner of an entity.
> 3. Alice gave permission to Bob for the entity. (Alice called `approve(Bob's address, the entity's tokenId)`).
> 4. Bob called `nuke(the entity's tokenId)`.
>
> In the scenario described above, it should be allowed for Bob to call `nuke(the entity's tokenId)`.
> However, Bob's call will be reverted due to the bug highlighted in the report.
>
> `nftContract.getApproved(tokenId)` returns Bob, not `address(this)`. Additionally, `msg.sender` 
at L160 is Bob who have not approved the `NukeFund` contract as an operator. Consequently, the `nuke()` 
function will be reverted unexpectedly.
