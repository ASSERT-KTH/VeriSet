The Development Team could potentially incur a loss on their SALT distribution reward due to the 
absence of access control on `VestingWallet#release()`.

When Salty exchange is actived, 10M SALT will be transferred to `teamVestingWallet` by calling 
[`InitialDistribution#distributionApproved()`]
(https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-salty/blob/main/src/launch/InitialDistribution.sol#L50-L74):

    62: 	salt.safeTransfer( address(teamVestingWallet), 10 * MILLION_ETHER );

`teamVestingWallet` is responsible for distributing 10M SALT linely over 10 years ([Deployment.sol#L100]
(https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-salty/blob/main/src/dev/Deployment.sol#L100)):

    teamVestingWallet = new VestingWallet( address(upkeep), uint64(block.timestamp), 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10 );

From the above code we can see that the beneficiary of `teamVestingWallet` is `Upkeep`.

Each time [`Upkeep#performUpkeep()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-salty/blob/main/src/Upkeep.sol#L244-L279) is called, 
`teamVestingWallet` will release a certain amount of SALT to `Upkeep`, the beneficiary, and then the relased SALT will be 
transferred to `mainWallet` of `managedTeamWallet`:

  function step11() public onlySameContract
  {
    uint256 releaseableAmount = VestingWallet(payable(exchangeConfig.teamVestingWallet())).releasable(address(salt));
    
    // teamVestingWallet actually sends the vested SALT to this contract - which will then need to be sent to the active teamWallet
    VestingWallet(payable(exchangeConfig.teamVestingWallet())).release(address(salt));
    
    salt.safeTransfer( exchangeConfig.managedTeamWallet().mainWallet(), releaseableAmount );
  }

However, there is no access control on `teamVestingWallet.release()`. Any one can call `release()` to distribute SALT without 
informing `upkeep`. `upkeep` doesn't know how many SALT has been distributed in advance, it has no way to transfer it to the 
development team, and the distributed SALT by directly calling `teamVestingWallet.release()` will be locked in `upkeep` forever.
