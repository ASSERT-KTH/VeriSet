The test is designed to showcase the issue. 
To begin with, the test checks that a sertain mount of SALT is releasable, 
that there is no SALT in Upkeep, and that there is no SALT in mainWallet.

Then it calls teamVestingWallet.release() before performUpkeep().
It checks that all released SALT is locked in Upkeep, and that mainWallet still is empty
(the development team has not recieved anything).
